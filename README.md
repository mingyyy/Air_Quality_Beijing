### Objective
Building a data pipeline from public sources to get insight into Beijing's Air Quality.

### Data Source
1. [Historical weather data](https://api.meteostat.net/#introduction) for cities in or near Beijing from meteostat JSON API.
Note that API key is needed and free account has access limit, up to 200 calls per key an hour.

2. [Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+Multi-Site+Air-Quality+Data), 
originally from Center for Statistical Science, Peking University.

3. [Beijing Air Quality Index (AQI) Data Set](https://datahub.ckan.io/dataset/610fb217-0499-40e7-b53f-a50c9b02b98f/resource/772b62d8-0847-4104-ad97-ceac7fb0438d/download/beijing-aqm.txt)

### Overview

#### Pipeline

#### Technology

Python, Spark, Redshift, Airflow

### Extraction

Most of the efforts are dedicated to sourcing data from various public open data projects. 
#### Source 1. meteostat API
From the meteostat API, we could have the historical hourly/daily/weekly weather records based on synoptical observations and METAR data. 
Note: gaps in the time series are filled with statistically optimised MOSMIX model data.

Given station id, start date, end date, time zone and time format, we get the following data points:
`temperature`, `dewpoint`, `humidity`, `precipitation`, `precipitation_3`, `precipitation_6`, `snowdepth`, `windspeed`, 
`peakgust`, `winddirection`, `pressure`, `condition`

Currently, the hourly dataset contains records from *1945-10-31* to *2020-01-08*. 

#### Source 2. CMA weather station Data
Based on the description at the website, We hve the Data Set and Attribute information for the well-defined data.
Since this is a one time historical clean data set, the idea here is to download the zip file to HDFS for further transformation

This data set includes hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally-controlled air-quality monitoring sites. 
The air-quality data are from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center. 
The meteorological data in each air-quality site are matched with the nearest weather station from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). 
The time period is from March 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2017. Missing data are denoted as NA.

#### AQI
 
This dataset could be downloaded directly in text format, containing hourly AQI (air quality index) reading starting 
from 2010-03-01 to 2016-05-31.
